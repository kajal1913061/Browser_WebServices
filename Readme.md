Here’s an explanation of the four methods you mentioned, which are part of the web service you want to implement for interacting with browsers like Google Chrome and Safari:

1. /start Method
Endpoint: /start?browser=<browser>&url=<url>

Parameters:

browser: The browser you want to start. It could be either chrome or safari.
url: The URL you want to open in the browser once it is started.
Functionality: This method is responsible for starting the specified browser and opening the provided URL. When this endpoint is hit, the service:

Verifies that the browser parameter is either chrome or safari.
Starts the browser with the provided URL. Depending on the platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), it constructs a command to open the browser and the URL.
On Windows, it uses the start command with chrome or safari.
On macOS, it uses the open -a command to launch the browser.
On Linux, it directly uses a command like google-chrome to launch Chrome.
Example Usage:

http://localhost:3000/start?browser=chrome&url=https://www.example.com
This will open Google Chrome with the URL https://www.example.com.
Expected Outcome:

The browser should open and load the given URL.
2. /stop Method
Endpoint: /stop?browser=<browser>

Parameters:

browser: The browser you want to stop. It could be either chrome or safari.
Functionality: This method is responsible for stopping (or killing) the browser that is currently running. When the endpoint is triggered:

It first checks if the browser parameter is either chrome or safari.
It then executes a command to terminate the browser's process using the exec function.
On macOS/Linux, the command used is pkill <browser>, where <browser> could be either Google Chrome or Safari.
Example Usage:

http://localhost:3000/stop?browser=chrome
This will kill the running Google Chrome process.
Expected Outcome:

The specified browser (Chrome or Safari) will be closed immediately.
3. /cleanup Method
Endpoint: /cleanup?browser=<browser>

Parameters:

browser: The browser you want to clean up. It could be either chrome or safari.
Functionality: This method is responsible for cleaning up the browsing session data, such as history, cache, cookies, saved passwords, etc., for the specified browser. When the endpoint is hit:

It checks if the specified browser is running.
If the browser is running, it attempts to kill the browser and remove session data.
Important: Before cleanup, it’s a good idea to backup any important data, as cleanup might erase critical session data.
Example Usage:

http://localhost:3000/cleanup?browser=chrome
This will clean up Google Chrome's session data after the browser is stopped.
Expected Outcome:

It should clear session data like browsing history, cookies, cache, saved passwords, etc., for the specified browser. However, this cleanup depends on platform-specific mechanisms and commands, and it’s important to be cautious, as it can remove user data.
4. /geturl Method
Endpoint: /geturl?browser=<browser>

Parameters:

browser: The browser you want to retrieve the active URL from. It could be either chrome or safari.
Functionality: This method retrieves the current active tab's URL in the specified browser. If the browser is running, it would:

Access the browser's active tab.
Return the current URL being displayed in that tab.
Example Usage:

http://localhost:3000/geturl?browser=chrome
This will retrieve the active URL from Google Chrome.
Expected Outcome:

The method should return the URL of the active tab in the specified browser. If no active URL can be found (for instance, if the browser is not running or there’s an error), an appropriate message should be returned (e.g., "No active tab found").
Key Notes:
start Method: Opens the browser with the specified URL.
stop Method: Closes the browser.
cleanup Method: Deletes the browsing session data for the browser.
geturl Method: Retrieves the current active tab’s URL in the browser.
These methods will allow you to interact programmatically with browsers via a web service, enabling you to start, stop, clean, and query the browsers for their active URLs. The service can be tested and used for automated tasks, such as clearing browsing sessions or opening specific websites for testing purposes.
